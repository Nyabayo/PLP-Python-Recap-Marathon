# Types of Python Operators
#
# Here's a list of different types of Python operators that we will learn in this tutorial.
#
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Bitwise Operators
# Special Operators

# 1. Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. For example,
# sub = 10 - 5 # 5
# Here, - is an arithmetic operator that subtracts two values or variables.
# operator	operation	example
# +	addition
add = 5 + 2
# -	subtraction
sub = 4 - 2
# *	multiplication
mult = 2 * 3
# **	exponentiation ( power)
pow = 4 ** 2
# /	float division
x = 4 / 2
# //	floor division
fl_division = 10 // 3
# %	modulus (remainder)
rem = 5 % 2


# 2. Python Assignment Operators
# Here's a list of different assignment operators available in Python.
# Operator	Example	Same As
# =	x = 5
k = 5
# +=
# o += 3
# t = t + 3
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
# :=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
# print(x)

# 3. Python Comparison Operators
#
# Comparison operators compare two values/variables and return a boolean result: True or False. For example
#
# Here, the > comparison operator is used to compare whether a is greater than b or not.
#
# Operator	Name	Example
# ==	Equal	2 == 2
# !=	Not equal	4 != 2
# >	Greater than	5 > 3
# <	Less than	2 < 7
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# 4. Python Logical Operators
#
# Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is True or False. They are used in decision-making. For example,
#
#
#
# Operator	Description	Example
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
