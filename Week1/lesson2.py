#All about python variables
#A variable is a container(storagge area) to hold data.
#Assigning values to variables
number = 90
school = "Power Learn Projects"
print(f"My school id {school} is {number}")
#Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a,b,c = "Love",2,3

#Rules for Naming Python Variables
# Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:
# 1. snake_case
# 2. MACRO_CASE
# 3. camelCase
# 4. CapsWords

# Python is case sensitive
